# Rental-Homes
Rental Homes Website

This project is a web-based platform for listing and renting homes, built using Django. The platform enables users to browse through available properties, apply filters based on location, price, and other criteria, and contact property owners directly. Property owners can register, list their homes, and manage rental inquiries seamlessly. The website aims to simplify the process of connecting renters with property owners by providing a user-friendly interface and efficient search functionalities.

The key features of this project include secure user authentication for both renters and property owners, allowing owners to create detailed property listings with price, location, and amenities information. Renters can use an intuitive search and filter system to find properties that meet their specific needs, and a built-in messaging system enables direct communication between renters and property owners. The platform is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices.

The technology stack for this project includes Django for the backend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using Bootstrap for responsiveness) on the frontend. The project uses SQLite as the default database but can easily be configured to work with PostgreSQL or MySQL. Additional tools include Django REST Framework for API functionality and Django Admin for managing users and property listings.

To set up the project locally, users can clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and apply migrations. Once the development server is running, users can register, log in, list properties, search for homes, and contact property owners. Future enhancements for the platform could include online payment integration, more advanced search filters (such as nearby amenities or property types), and the ability for renters to leave reviews and ratings for properties theyâ€™ve rented.
